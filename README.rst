PyPDE
=====

A Python library for solving any system of hyperbolic or parabolic Partial Differential Equations.
The PDEs can have stiff source terms and non-conservative components.

Key Features:

* Any first or second order system of PDEs
* Your fluxes and sources are written in Python for ease
* Any number of spatial dimensions
* Arbitrary order of accuracy
* C++ under the hood for speed
* Based on the ADER-WENO method

``pip install pypde``

Background
----------

We can solve any system of PDEs of the form:

   :alt: Godunov-Romenski equations
   :align: center

or, more succinctly:

Note that this includes the Navier-Stokes equations:

where:

   :align: center

and the Reactive Euler equations:

   :align: center

where ``K`` is a (potentially large) function depending on temperature ``T``.

It also includes the the Godunov-Romenski equations:

where now Î¸ is a (potentially very small) function of A, and:
